Project Description:
This Project is about the Gender Wage Gap in the US. According to Center for American Progess (https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2015/04/14/110962/women-of-color-and-the-gender-wage-gap/) on an average women earned 78% of what men earned in 2013 across all ethnicities. Till this day we know taht women earn significantly less for doing the same work. My Project dives into the details about the facts about the Gender Wage Gap. Since it also involves a lot of biases and difference in culture, it will not conclude with what exact factors cause gender wage gaps. However it will show the gender wage gaps in the US states and what might partly explain the gap . In my project I try to find correlations with educational attainment of women in total, by Bachelors degree and Graduate Degree. I analyze gaps in median wages in different industries in a few selected states. Then I move into a broader perspective of US as a whole and how the gender wage gap varies by industries, marital status and race.
